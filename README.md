# MyGPT

MyGPT is an educational project that utilizes the OpenAI API to create a conversational AI interface. It allows users to interact with the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model by providing text prompts or questions.

MyGPT is built using React.js for the frontend, along with HTML and CSS for styling. The project demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI API into a web application to create conversational AI capabilities.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Engage in conversations with the AI model by providing text prompts.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilize the power of the OpenAI API to generate human-like responses to user queries.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed for educational purposes to showcase how to incorporate AI technologies into web applications using React.js.

## Installation

To set up the MyGPT project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mygpt.git











# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
